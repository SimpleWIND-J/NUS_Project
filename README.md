***About mode***
The default mode is "single player mode" and you can select your own skin or select multi-player mode

To control the 2 players in the multi-player mode , use "W A S D" or "I J K L"

***Game rules***
Try to avoid all the "monsters" and eat as much 'coins'(the yellow dots) as you can !

When all the coins are ate , you enter the next level(where the monsters will be faster and "smarter")

You have 3 lives in one level , if you are caught by a monster , you lose one life , get reborned and can immune from the monsters for 1.5s

You may have noticed that there are also "power-dot"(white dots) in the map . When you eat a power dot , you get very strong and can even eat the monsters ! The monsters eaten by you will reborn from the middle of the map in 5s , make use of this powerful tool!
